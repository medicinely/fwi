# Quantifying uncertainty of 2D seismic wave propagation

## The goal is to obtain the posterior distribution of the velocity model by implementing a variational bayesian/neural network using the gradient decent.

## Requirements:
Tensorflow 2.10.0

keywords:
Full waveform inversion, Inverse problem, Variational Autoencoder (vae), Deep Learning
