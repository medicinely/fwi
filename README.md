# Quantifying uncertainties in 2D seismic wave propagation

The goal is to obtain the posterior distribution of the velocity model by implementing a variational bayesian/neural network using the gradient decent.

### Requirements:
Tensorflow 2.10.0

### Keywords:
Full waveform inversion, Inverse problem, Variational Autoencoder (vae), Deep Learning
