To explain the MCMC approach for obtaining the posterior distribution, let's start with Bayes' theorem:

$$ P(\mathbf{m}|\mathbf{d}) = \frac{P(\mathbf{d}|\mathbf{m})P(\mathbf{m})}{P(\mathbf{d})} $$

where $\mathbf{m}$ is the velocity model, $\mathbf{d}$ is the observed data, $P(\mathbf{m}|\mathbf{d})$ is the posterior distribution, $P(\mathbf{d}|\mathbf{m})$ is the likelihood function, $P(\mathbf{m})$ is the prior distribution, and $P(\mathbf{d})$ is the evidence.

In seismic inversion, we typically assume that the likelihood function is a Gaussian distribution:

$$ P(\mathbf{d}|\mathbf{m}) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{(2\pi)^N|\mathbf{C}|}}exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{d}-\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{m}))^T\mathbf{C}^{-1}(\mathbf{d}-\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{m}))\right) $$

where $\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{m})$ is the forward model that predicts the data, $\mathbf{C}$ is the data covariance matrix, and $N$ is the number of data points.

The prior distribution $P(\mathbf{m})$ represents our prior knowledge or assumptions about the velocity model before we see the data. This is typically represented as a multivariate normal distribution:

$$ P(\mathbf{m}) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{(2\pi)^k|\mathbf{\Sigma}|}}exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{m}-\mathbf{\mu})^T\mathbf{\Sigma}^{-1}(\mathbf{m}-\mathbf{\mu})\right) $$

where $\mathbf{\mu}$ is the mean vector and $\mathbf{\Sigma}$ is the covariance matrix.

To obtain the posterior distribution, we need to sample from the joint distribution $P(\mathbf{m},\mathbf{d})$. However, this is often intractable due to the high dimensionality of the problem and the complexity of the forward model. Therefore, we use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to generate samples from the joint distribution.

The idea behind MCMC is to construct a Markov chain that has the joint distribution $P(\mathbf{m},\mathbf{d})$ as its stationary distribution. This means that if we run the Markov chain for long enough, the samples will be distributed according to the joint distribution.

The most commonly used MCMC algorithm for seismic inversion is the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The algorithm proceeds as follows:

Start with an initial guess $\mathbf{m}_0$ for the velocity model.
Generate a proposal $\mathbf{m}^$ for the velocity model by sampling from a proposal distribution $Q(\mathbf{m}^|\mathbf{m}_i)$.
Calculate the acceptance ratio $\alpha = min\left(1, \frac{P(\mathbf{m}^|\mathbf{d})Q(\mathbf{m}_i|\mathbf{m}^)}{P(\mathbf{m}_i|\mathbf
